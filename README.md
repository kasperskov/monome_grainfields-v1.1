#### 8 voice granular synthesizer for monome 128 grids

grainfields turns your 128 grid into a granular synthesizer with 8 voices - each with up to 10 constant streaming grains. Modulate grain parameters (pitch, duration, loop rate, position etc.) of each voice to create a large variety of interesting timbres and textures. Record and loop pattern gestures to create rythmic and melodic sequences.

#### Getting started

Before launching grainfields make sure that your grid is connected. At the lower right corner of the app go to 'audio & osc setup' and choose your device in the serialosc dropdown (should auto detect).

Set your audio settings and enable audio.

#### 8 rows / 8 voices

Every row represents a voice, and each voice contains a buffer with up to 10 individual grains. To change buffer content simply drag and drop an audio file into the waveform display of a voice.

#### Grid controls

- Each voice is activated by pressing the far left toggle on the grid.
- The pattern recorder is activated when pressing the second toggle from the left.
- Step 3-15 on each row control the playback position of the buffer audio content.
- The far right toggle records an input into the buffer of the selected voice (change input source in the 'audio & osc setup' menu in the app).

#### Grain parameters

Control the grain density, base pitch and deviation, duration, loop rate, amplitude, envelope slope, and stereo spread of each voice. Additional parameters include:

- 'speed' - sets the speed of moving between grain positions in miliseconds.
- 'fade' - sets the fade in / out time when activating / deactivating a voice.
- 'rec length' - sets the length of recording into the buffer.

#### Global transport & pattern recorder

Start / stop transport by pressing the space bar. The transport needs to be activated in order to record pattern gestures.

Set the desired length of the pattern loop in bars (default=2).

#### Recording into buffer

When recording an input source into a buffer the buffer will autosave the recording into the project folder (located inside the "media" folder).

#### Master presets

Saving a preset (shift>click on a slot) will store all current parameter settings in each voice as well as the file path of buffer contents.

#### Lemur interface 

Control individual voices directly in the application or via the included Lemur interface (requires Lemur on iPad).

Install the interface on iPad ('monome_grainfields.jzml' located in the project folder) and make sure to provide the correct port and host settings for incoming and outgoing OSC.
